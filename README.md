# Spot
A modern, fast and open-source **Minecraft** server with a focus on **performance** and **vanilla experience**. Built on top of the **Rust** and **without any code from Mojang**.

### Notice: This project is still in hard development and is not ready for production.

### Trivia

- Etymology of the name **“Spot”**: We hope that our project costs as little as a spot compared to the Notchian server.
